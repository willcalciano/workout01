## Workout 1

* This is the first project in stat 133 which involves using github to create an remote repository as a final product
* The goal of the project is to create rankings of basketball teams based on a set of given statistics
* Given data about all NBA players in 2018, the main goal of this project is to create a new data set called nba2018-teams.csv which contains data about teams as a whole using dplyr and other .R strategies
* The final objective of the project is to display bar charts which rank the teams in the NBA based on a few statistics, including an index which we get to pick/make
